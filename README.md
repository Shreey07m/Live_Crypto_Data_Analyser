# Live_Crypto_Data_Analyser
I developed this Crypto Data Analyser is a Python project that fetches, analyses, and presents real-time data for the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market cap using the CoinGecko API. It collects key metrics like price, market cap, volume, and 24-hour changes, updating the data every 5 minutes in an Excel sheet for easy access and analysis.
